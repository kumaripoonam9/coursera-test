	<h1>Anatomy of a CSS rule</h1>

	<h2>Subheading 1</h2>

		I slide the cool material of my shirt over the five long, jagged scars on my arm and examine myself in the reflector. Blue,	long-sleeved tunic. Gray pants. Silver bracelet with a single star.	The star and the smudges of fatigue under my eyes mark me as an entry-level University student. My fellow classmates show similar signs of having studied late into the night for today. After six months of taking the same preliminary classes, all twenty of us will be tested and sorted into the fields of study that will serve as the focus for the rest of our lives.

		Aside from my family, one other person has managed to get news to me. My best friend, Daileen, assures me sheâ€™s studying hard and is currently first in her class. Her teacher has hinted Daileen might be chosen for The Testing this year. She is keeping	her fingers crossed that she will join me in Tosu City. I am hoping she will fail. I want her to stay in a place where the answers to questions make sense. Where I know she will be safe.
